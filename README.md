### Installation

> **NOTE** 
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Requirements:
* Make sure to review the readmes of the plugins if you are experiencing errors. In particular:
  * [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is required for multiple [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies) pickers.
* See [Windows Installation](#Windows-Installation) if you have trouble with `telescope-fzf-native`

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, '~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows | `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\` |

### Post Installation

Run the following command and then **you are ready to go**!

```sh
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```

### FAQ
* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up, then delete all files associated with it.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local` which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
  * You may also want to look at the [migration guide for lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-migration-guide)
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-uninstalling) information

### Windows Installation

Installation may require installing build tools, and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake, and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
